Pong Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and the Turtle library.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Turtle library
How to play
Player 1 (left side) moves their paddle up and down using the "W" and "S" keys.
Player 2 (right side) moves their paddle up and down using the up and down arrow keys.
The objective is to score points by hitting the ball with the paddle and making it go past the opponent's paddle.
The first player to score 3 points wins the game.
