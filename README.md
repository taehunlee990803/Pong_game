    <h1>Pong Game</h1>
    <p>This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and the Turtle library.</p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Python 3.x</li>
      <li>Turtle library</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <p>Player 1 (left side) moves their paddle up and down using the "W" and "S" keys.</p>
    <p>Player 2 (right side) moves their paddle up and down using the up and down arrow keys.</p>
    <p>The objective is to score points by hitting the ball with the paddle and making it go past the opponent's paddle.</p>
    <p>The first player to score 3 points wins the game.</p>
    <h2>Files</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>main.py: Contains the main game loop and controls the behavior of the game.</li>
      <li>paddle.py: Defines the Paddle class, which creates the paddles for each player and allows them to move up and down.</li>
      <li>ball.py: Defines the Ball class, which creates the ball and controls its movement and behavior.</li>
      <li>scoreboard.py: Defines the Scoreboard class, which keeps track of the score for each player and displays it on the screen.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Running the game</h2>
    <p>To run the game, simply run the main.py file in your terminal:</p>
    <pre><code>python main.py</code></pre>
    <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
    <p>This game was created as a learning project inspired by freeCodeCamp.org's tutorial on creating Pong with Python and Turtle.</p>
